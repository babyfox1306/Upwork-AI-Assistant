When we say every product that companies need to run their business, we really mean it!</p><p>We are:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Product-led</strong>. More than 100,000 companies have installed PostHog, mostly driven by word-of-mouth. We have intensely strong product-market fit.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/aord.html\"><strong><u>Default alive</u></strong></a>. Revenue is growing 10% MoM on average, and we're very efficient. We raise money to push ambition and grow faster, not to keep the lights on.</p></li><li><p><strong>Well-funded.</strong> We've raised more than $100m from some of the world's top <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/strategy/investors\"><u>investors</u></a>. We're set up for a long, ambitious journey.</p></li></ol><p>We're focused on building an awesome product for end users, hiring exceptional teammates, shipping fast, and <a href=\"https://posthog.com/deskhog\"><u>being as weird as possible</u></a>.</p><p><br /></p><h2>Things we care about</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Transparency:</strong> Everyone can read about our roadmap, how we pay (or even let go of) people, our strategy, and how we work, in our <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook\"><u>public company handbook</u></a>. Internally, we share revenue, notes and slides from board meetings, and fundraising plans, so everyone has the context they need to make good decisions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Autonomy:</strong> We donât tell anyone what to do. Everyone chooses what to work on next based on what's going to have the biggest impact on our customers, and what they find interesting and motivating to work on. <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/wide-company\"><u>Engineers lead product teams</u></a> and <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/which-products\"><u>make product decisions</u></a>. Teams are flexible and easy to change when needed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shipping fast:</strong> <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/values#why-not-now\"><u>Why not now?</u></a> We want to build a lot of products; we can't do that shipping at a normal pace. We've built the company around small teams â autonomous, highly-efficient groups of <a href=\"https://posthog.com/founders/cracked-manifesto\"><u>cracked engineers</u></a> who can outship much larger companies because they own their products end-to-end.</p></li><li><p><strong>Time for building:</strong> Nothing gets shipped in a meeting. We're a natively remote company. We default to async communication â PRs &gt; Issues &gt; Slack. Tuesdays and Thursdays are <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/company/culture#were-on-the-makers-schedule\"><u>meeting-free days</u></a>, and we prioritize heads down building time over perfect coordination. This will be the most productive job you've ever had.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ambition:</strong> We want to solve big problems. We strongly believe that aiming for the best possible upside, and sometimes missing, is better than never trying. We're optimistic about what's possible and our ability to get there.</p></li><li><p><strong>Being weird:</strong> Weird means redesigning an already world-class website for the 5th time. It means shipping <em>literally</em> every product that relates to customer data. It means building an <a href=\"https://posthog.com/deskhog\"><u>objectively unnecessary developer toy</u></a> with dubious shareholder value. Doing weird stuff is a competitive advantage. And it's fun.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Who we're looking for</strong></h2><p>We're hiring for a range of roles here. What you end up working on will depend on your exact skillset and preferences, so choose your own adventure.</p><p>In general we seek Product Engineers who are:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Enthusiastic drivers.</strong> We need proactive people that can fully own projects and get them done, and know to get help when needed. This is what being a <a href=\"https://posthog.com/blog/what-is-a-product-engineer\"><u>product engineer</u></a> is all about. \"Are we there yet?\" is the wrong question.</p></li><li><p><strong>Optimistic problem solvers.</strong> Things get hard here sometimes â whether it's scaling, shipping complex products, handling a stream of support requests, or trying to ship something that touches multiple teams. We need people who won't get disheartened, and will collaborate, iterate, and ship their way out of anything.</p></li><li><p><strong>Grown ups.</strong> Weâre an international bunch of weirdos, but one thing unites us: everyone is kind, considerate, and professional towards each other. <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/company/grown-ups\"><u>This isn't about age or experience</u></a>, it's about being low-ego, flexible, and respectful.</p></li><li><p><strong>Genuine builders.</strong> PostHog is full of people who just love building stuff, people who would still be building software even if there wasn't a paycheck at the end. If this sounds like you, we should talk.</p></li></ul><p><br /></p><p>Right now, we are also looking for:</p><ul><li><p><strong>IAM specialist:</strong> Youâll design and ship core features like SAML support, new identity providers, and even our own IAM system. Start with internal tooling, then roll them out to customers. Tell us how youâd make these systems so solid that other teams can build on them without hesitation.</p></li></ul><p><br /></p><h2><strong>What you'll be doing</strong></h2><ul><li><p><strong>Owning products and features from beginning to end.</strong> This means originating ideas based on your intuition, talking to users, and understanding our strategy and goals. It means testing MVPs in production with real users. It means <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/engineering/product-engineering\"><u>iterating on their feedback</u></a>, owning pricing, and ensuring the ongoing success of your work.</p></li><li><p><strong>Collaborating with design (when necessary).</strong> Product engineers at PostHog are full stack, so we expect you to ship and own the basic UX of your work using <a href=\"https://storybook.posthog.net/\"><u>our design system</u></a><strong>.</strong> From there, it's up to you to decide when to <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/engineering/product-design\"><u>collaborate with our design team</u></a> to iterate and polish the experience.</p></li><li><p><strong>Talking to users.</strong> Good product engineers read feedback from users and iterate quickly. Great product engineers have users they're friendly with, talk with them frequently, bounce ideas off them, and iterate with them when they ship new things.</p></li><li><p><strong>Doing support.</strong> Every week, one person in each engineering team is designated the <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/engineering/support-hero\"><u>Support hero</u></a>. Their job is to investigate and resolve issues reported by customers for their product. Giving users support from real engineers, and shipping fixes and improvements in real-time, is one of the best ways to spark joy in users. This role will also include some <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/engineering/on-call-rotation\"><u>on-call time</u></a>, too.</p></li><li><p><strong>Writing docs.</strong> We have a content team that will collaborate with you on reviewing, polishing, and improving your documentation, but the best person to document a new feature is the person who built it.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Requirements</strong></h2><ul><li><p>Full-stack experience with <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/engineering/stack\"><u>relevant technologies</u></a> â e.g. Python or similar, React or similar, something to do with big data is a bonus.</p></li><li><p>Experience taking a project from 0 to 1.

The ability to communicate your ideas and make persuasive arguments is essential.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Nice to have</strong></h2><ul><li><p>Have worked at a high-growth SaaS company before.</p></li><li><p>Extensive knowledge of Django and/or TypeScript-based React.</p></li><li><p>Experience building AI-native products, or integrating AI into existing software.</p></li></ul><p><em><br /></em></p><p><em>If you have a disability, please let us know if there's any way we can make the interview process better for you - we're happy to accommodate! </em></p><br/><br/>Please mention the word **ENTICE** and tag RMy4yMzkuMTIwLjg3 when applying to show you read the job post completely (#RMy4yMzkuMTIwLjg3).

{"job_id": "af1b3ddafc49", "title": "Senior Product Manager", "description": "<h3>About Maven</h3>\n<p>Maven is reinventing our post-secondary education system from the ground up. We're starting with practical, professional courses on key skills taught by leading experts in your field. Think: learning AI Product Management from a head of product at OpenAI or an engineering lead at Meta. Our cohort-based model means our engagement rates are 80-90% instead of the 5-10% from video-based learning. Maven's marketplace has 500+ expert-led cohort-based courses, 70K+ student alumni, and 700K+ registered users.

When we say every product that companies need to run their business, we really mean it!</p><p>We are:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Product-led</strong>. More than 100,000 companies have installed PostHog, mostly driven by word-of-mouth. We have intensely strong product-market fit.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/aord.html\"><strong><u>Default alive</u></strong></a>. Revenue is growing 10% MoM on average, and we're very efficient. We raise money to push ambition and grow faster, not to keep the lights on.</p></li><li><p><strong>Well-funded.</strong> We've raised more than $100m from some of the world's top <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/strategy/investors\"><u>investors</u></a>. We're set up for a long, ambitious journey.</p></li></ol><p>We're focused on building an awesome product for end users, hiring exceptional teammates, shipping fast, and <a href=\"https://posthog.com/deskhog\"><u>being as weird as possible</u></a>.</p><p><br /></p><h2>Things we care about</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Transparency:</strong> Everyone can read about our roadmap, how we pay (or even let go of) people, our strategy, and how we work, in our <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook\"><u>public company handbook</u></a>. Internally, we share revenue, notes and slides from board meetings, and fundraising plans, so everyone has the context they need to make good decisions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Autonomy:</strong> We don’t tell anyone what to do. Everyone chooses what to work on next based on what's going to have the biggest impact on our customers, and what they find interesting and motivating to work on. <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/wide-company\"><u>Engineers lead product teams</u></a> and <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/which-products\"><u>make product decisions</u></a>. Teams are flexible and easy to change when needed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shipping fast:</strong> <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/values#why-not-now\"><u>Why not now?</u></a> We want to build a lot of products; we can't do that shipping at a normal pace. We've built the company around small teams – autonomous, highly-efficient groups of <a href=\"https://posthog.com/founders/cracked-manifesto\"><u>cracked engineers</u></a> who can outship much larger companies because they own their products end-to-end.</p></li><li><p><strong>Time for building:</strong> Nothing gets shipped in a meeting. We're a natively remote company. We default to async communication – PRs &gt; Issues &gt; Slack. Tuesdays and Thursdays are <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/company/culture#were-on-the-makers-schedule\"><u>meeting-free days</u></a>, and we prioritize heads down building time over perfect coordination. This will be the most productive job you've ever had.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ambition:</strong> We want to solve big problems. We strongly believe that aiming for the best possible upside, and sometimes missing, is better than never trying. We're optimistic about what's possible and our ability to get there.</p></li><li><p><strong>Being weird:</strong> Weird means redesigning an already world-class website for the 5th time. It means shipping <em>literally</em> every product that relates to customer data. It means building an <a href=\"https://posthog.com/deskhog\"><u>objectively unnecessary developer toy</u></a> with dubious shareholder value. Doing weird stuff is a competitive advantage. And it's fun.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Who we're looking for</strong></h2><p>We're hiring for a range of roles here. What you end up working on will depend on your exact skillset and preferences, so choose your own adventure.</p><p>In general we seek Product Engineers who are:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Enthusiastic drivers.</strong> We need proactive people that can fully own projects and get them done, and know to get help when needed. This is what being a <a href=\"https://posthog.com/blog/what-is-a-product-engineer\"><u>product engineer</u></a> is all about. \"Are we there yet?\" is the wrong question.</p></li><li><p><strong>Optimistic problem solvers.</strong> Things get hard here sometimes – whether it's scaling, shipping complex products, handling a stream of support requests, or trying to ship something that touches multiple teams. We need people who won't get disheartened, and will collaborate, iterate, and ship their way out of anything.</p></li><li><p><strong>Grown ups.</strong> We’re an international bunch of weirdos, but one thing unites us: everyone is kind, considerate, and professional towards each other. <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/company/grown-ups\"><u>This isn't about age or experience</u></a>, it's about being low-ego, flexible, and respectful.</p></li><li><p><strong>Genuine builders.</strong> PostHog is full of people who just love building stuff, people who would still be building software even if there wasn't a paycheck at the end. If this sounds like you, we should talk.</p></li></ul><p><br /></p><p>Right now, we are also looking for:</p><ul><li><p><strong>IAM specialist:</strong> You’ll design and ship core features like SAML support, new identity providers, and even our own IAM system. Start with internal tooling, then roll them out to customers. Tell us how you’d make these systems so solid that other teams can build on them without hesitation.</p></li></ul><p><br /></p><h2><strong>What you'll be doing</strong></h2><ul><li><p><strong>Owning products and features from beginning to end.</strong> This means originating ideas based on your intuition, talking to users, and understanding our strategy and goals. It means testing MVPs in production with real users. It means <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/engineering/product-engineering\"><u>iterating on their feedback</u></a>, owning pricing, and ensuring the ongoing success of your work.</p></li><li><p><strong>Collaborating with design (when necessary).</strong> Product engineers at PostHog are full stack, so we expect you to ship and own the basic UX of your work using <a href=\"https://storybook.posthog.net/\"><u>our design system</u></a><strong>.</strong> From there, it's up to you to decide when to <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/engineering/product-design\"><u>collaborate with our design team</u></a> to iterate and polish the experience.</p></li><li><p><strong>Talking to users.</strong> Good product engineers read feedback from users and iterate quickly. Great product engineers have users they're friendly with, talk with them frequently, bounce ideas off them, and iterate with them when they ship new things.</p></li><li><p><strong>Doing support.</strong> Every week, one person in each engineering team is designated the <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/engineering/support-hero\"><u>Support hero</u></a>. Their job is to investigate and resolve issues reported by customers for their product. Giving users support from real engineers, and shipping fixes and improvements in real-time, is one of the best ways to spark joy in users. This role will also include some <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/engineering/on-call-rotation\"><u>on-call time</u></a>, too.</p></li><li><p><strong>Writing docs.</strong> We have a content team that will collaborate with you on reviewing, polishing, and improving your documentation, but the best person to document a new feature is the person who built it.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Requirements</strong></h2><ul><li><p>Full-stack experience with <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/engineering/stack\"><u>relevant technologies</u></a> – e.g. Python or similar, React or similar, something to do with big data is a bonus.</p></li><li><p>Experience taking a project from 0 to 1.

The ability to communicate your ideas and make persuasive arguments is essential.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Nice to have</strong></h2><ul><li><p>Have worked at a high-growth SaaS company before.</p></li><li><p>Extensive knowledge of Django and/or TypeScript-based React.</p></li><li><p>Experience building AI-native products, or integrating AI into existing software.</p></li></ul><p><em><br /></em></p><p><em>If you have a disability, please let us know if there's any way we can make the interview process better for you - we're happy to accommodate! </em></p>", "link": "https://remoteOK.com/remote-jobs/remote-product-engineer-posthog-1128992", "budget": "100", "proposals": null, "client_country": "their first day", "category": "React", "source": "RemoteOK - Dev Jobs", "source_type": "rss", "created_at": "2025-11-19T19:46:18+00:00", "crawled_at": "2025-11-22T07:21:48.420683"}

You'll work collaboratively with other members of the engineering team to design, develop, implement, and evolve our data pipeline and approaches.</p><p>Every day will look a little different, but in general, you will do things like:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Own Data Sourcing Pipelines:</strong> You'll be responsible for helping to architect our data warehousing, ingestion and sourcing strategy, working with multiple SDKs to aggregate data from various sources into Blockwork's own data warehouse.</p></li><li><p><strong>Design and Implement ETL Solutions:</strong> You'll be responsible for implementing our overall ETL approach, including accessing &amp; setting up blockchain nodes to pull from, sourcing data from 3rd parties, and modeling our internal schemas across our PostgreSQL database(s)</p></li><li><p><strong>Grow Shared Knowledge:</strong> You'll help provide technical leadership, guidance, and assistance to the team in the implementation of established architectures and designs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Drive Operational Efficiency:</strong> You'll be constantly looking for opportunities to improve data workflows and reliably automate routine tasks.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cross-Functional Collaboration:</strong> You'll work with other teams across Blockworks, including Research, Product, and Engineering, to lead initiatives and move collaborations forward.</p></li></ul><p>Experimentation is frequent at Blockworks. Comfortability with being uncomfortable is a must.</p><p></p><h2><strong>What You’ve Done Before:</strong></h2><p>For this role, first and foremost, you must have significant knowledge of the crypto industry; interest in crypto is not enough, we’re looking for someone who considers themself crypto native. You have at least 4 (but ideally more) years of hands-on experience with data modeling, schema design, data operations, and data warehousing. During that time, you've personally built backend systems at scale with a focus on data processing and ingestion. You're an ace at Typescript, Go, and/or Python, and you bring incredibly strong expertise in SQL (ideally Postgres, dbt, and Hypertables). You have deep experience creating data warehouses using Timescale, Snowflake, and/or BigQuery, and you also bring experience using DevOps tools and solutions like Docker, CI/CD, and AWS.</p><p></p><h2><strong>It’d Be Great If You’ve Done This:</strong></h2><p>Experience and demonstrated success in crypto, web3, startup, or incubator environments will move you to the top of the list. A background in designing, building, and managing microservices will also set you apart, especially if you bring expertise in security, privacy, and scalability. We’re especially interested in candidates who can pair technical depth with an ability to thrive in high-growth, fast-paced settings.</p><p>What will truly make you stand out is hands-on experience with Solana. If you’ve built and operated Solana ingestion pipelines using RPC, Websocket, or Geyser with resilience to forks and automated backfills, you’ll be a huge asset to our team. We’re looking for engineers who can decode transactions, instructions, and events, and ship modeled data into Postgres, Clickhouse, or Parquet with speed and accuracy. Fluency in decoding native programs such as System, Stake, SPL Token, Token2022, and Memo, along with Anchor programs, while managing IDLs, Borsh layouts, and maintaining an internal decoder registry, would set you apart as a Solana expert.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Salary, Benefits, &amp; How We Work:</strong></h2><p>This is a full time exempt position with an expected salary of $160,000 - $200,000/year.</p><p></p><h1><strong>Benefits:</strong></h1><p><strong>Remote-First: </strong></p><p>We're a remote-first organization with an office in NYC for you to utilize as you please.</p><p><strong>100% Medical Coverage for You: </strong></p><p>Close to fully paid medical, dental, and vision insurance for you, and a significant portion covered for your dependents.</p><p><strong>Flexible PTO: </strong></p><p>We have a flexible paid time off policy that doesn't limit the number of vacation days you can take.</p><p><strong>Parental Leave: </strong></p><p>At Blockworks, all team members are eligible for 14 weeks of fully paid parental leave.</p><p><strong>Hardware Stipend:</strong> </p><p>Every team member has a stipend to use to purchase the tools and technology that help them be their most productive.</p><p><strong>Learning &amp; Growth Stipend:</strong> </p><p>Every team member has a stipend to spend on their skill growth and professional development.</p><p><strong>Career Growth:</strong> </p><p>We prioritize skill growth and career development, and we have a clear, documented structure to take the guesswork out of individual development and career progression</p><p><strong>Global &amp; Diverse Team: </strong></p><p>We're a global team, and we're committed to creating an open, inclusive, and diverse work culture</p><p></p><h1><strong>Come build with us; we're just getting started!</strong></h1><p></p><p>We know that diversity makes for the best problem-solving and creative thinking.

This is what being a <a href=\"https://posthog.com/blog/what-is-a-product-engineer\"><u>product engineer</u></a> is all about. \"Are we there yet?\" is the wrong question.</p></li><li><p><strong>Optimistic problem solvers.</strong> Things get hard here sometimes – whether it's scaling, shipping complex products, handling a stream of support requests, or trying to ship something that touches multiple teams. We need people who won't get disheartened, and will collaborate, iterate, and ship their way out of anything.</p></li><li><p><strong>Grown ups.</strong> We’re an international bunch of weirdos, but one thing unites us: everyone is kind, considerate, and professional towards each other. <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/company/grown-ups\"><u>This isn't about age or experience</u></a>, it's about being low-ego, flexible, and respectful.</p></li><li><p><strong>Genuine builders.</strong> PostHog is full of people who just love building stuff, people who would still be building software even if there wasn't a paycheck at the end. If this sounds like you, we should talk.</p></li></ul><p><br /></p><p>Right now, we are also looking for:</p><ul><li><p><strong>IAM specialist:</strong> You’ll design and ship core features like SAML support, new identity providers, and even our own IAM system.

WISEcode makes personalized nutrition a reality based on facts — what truly is in our food — and marries this data with your preferences. Driven by AI and the world’s most advanced food and nutrition database, WISEcode embraces the truth that we are all different: different needs, objectives, biology, and preferences. No one should be at the mercy of market spin or “expert” opinion. Everyone deserves the clarity required to make the best decisions for themselves.We are building what does not yet exist: a platform that codifies food transparency, decodes ingredients, and exposes the hidden realities of packaged food.

Our Principal Engineers are restless builders who transform complexity into clarity, elevate every team they touch, and create architecture that accelerates the entire company. These are strategic technologists who see systems where others see fragments, who bring long-term thinking into every decision, and who translate bold ideas into elegant, scalable solutions.</span></p><p><br /></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">About the Role</span></p><p><br /></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">The Principal Engineer (PE) is WISEcode’s highest-impact individual-contributor role — a technical leader who combines deep hands-on engineering with architectural ownership across major parts of the platform. PEs write excellent code, but also define system boundaries, long-term technical direction, and engineering standards that influence the entire organization.</span></p><p><br /></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">A WISEcode PE is both strategist and builder. You will:</span></p><p><br /></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">●&nbsp;Translate product ideas, data models, and company vision into durable architectures.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">●&nbsp;Jumpstart high-complexity features or systems end-to-end and hand them off once patterns are established.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">●&nbsp;Guide teams through decisions on reliability, performance, schema evolution, observability, AI integration, and scale.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">●&nbsp;Influence without authority — shaping engineering culture, mentoring senior engineers, and raising the organizational bar.</span></p><p><br /></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">PEs at WISEcode operate as a flexible, high-impact bench. You may embed temporarily into a product team to help them accelerate a difficult initiative, unblock architectural issues, or deliver a full-stack vertical slice (UI → API → DB/Lakehouse → infrastructure). You’ll then step out, leaving behind a coherent design, patterns the team can extend, and clearer technical direction than before.</span></p><p><br /></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Because of their breadth, PEs typically work closely with the CTO and maintain visibility across products, data systems, and infrastructure. Your success is measured not by a single team’s velocity, but by the health, performance, and agility of the entire WISEcode ecosystem.</span></p><p><br /></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">How Principal Engineers Operate at WISEcode</span></p><p><br /></p><p><b style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Systems thinkers with depth.</b><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"> PEs bring T-shaped skills: deep expertise in multiple domains (e.g., .NET architecture, Postgres/Lakehouse design, distributed systems, AI integration) and broad understanding across UX, product strategy, data modeling, cloud infrastructure, and developer experience.</span></p><p><b style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Architects who execute.</b><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"> You can design a new ingestion pipeline, tune a Postgres query plan, implement a Blazor UI, and architect a multi-service feature — and know how these pieces must evolve over time.</span></p><p><b style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Product-savvy technologists.</b><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"> PEs help shape product direction, not just implement requirements. You anticipate what’s possible, clarify ambiguity, and often write the first version of a spec when needed.</span></p><p><b style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Pragmatic long-term thinkers.</b><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"> You balance delivery speed with architectural integrity. You know where to take shortcuts — and where not to.</span></p><p><b style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Multipliers.</b><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"> You leave teams stronger: cleaner abstractions, clearer documentation, higher engineering maturity, and faster future delivery.</span></p><p><br /></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">AI Skills &amp; Leadership</span></p><p><br /></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">WISEcode is an AI-native company.

PEs write excellent code, but also define system boundaries, long-term technical direction, and engineering standards that influence the entire organization.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px\">A WISEcode PE is both strategist and builder. You will:</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px\">â&nbsp;Translate product ideas, data models, and company vision into durable architectures.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px\">â&nbsp;Jumpstart high-complexity features or systems end-to-end and hand them off once patterns are established.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px\">â&nbsp;Guide teams through decisions on reliability, performance, schema evolution, observability, AI integration, and scale.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px\">â&nbsp;Influence without authority â shaping engineering culture, mentoring senior engineers, and raising the organizational bar.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px\">PEs at WISEcode operate as a flexible, high-impact bench. You may embed temporarily into a product team to help them accelerate a difficult initiative, unblock architectural issues, or deliver a full-stack vertical slice (UI â API â DB/Lakehouse â infrastructure). Youâll then step out, leaving behind a coherent design, patterns the team can extend, and clearer technical direction than before.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px\">Because of their breadth, PEs typically work closely with the CTO and maintain visibility across products, data systems, and infrastructure. Your success is measured not by a single teamâs velocity, but by the health, performance, and agility of the entire WISEcode ecosystem.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px\">How Principal Engineers Operate at WISEcode</span></p><p><br></p><p><b style=\"font-size: 16px\">Systems thinkers with depth.</b><span style=\"font-size: 16px\"> PEs bring T-shaped skills: deep expertise in multiple domains (e.g., .NET architecture, Postgres/Lakehouse design, distributed systems, AI integration) and broad understanding across UX, product strategy, data modeling, cloud infrastructure, and developer experience.</span></p><p><b style=\"font-size: 16px\">Architects who execute.</b><span style=\"font-size: 16px\"> You can design a new ingestion pipeline, tune a Postgres query plan, implement a Blazor UI, and architect a multi-service feature â and know how these pieces must evolve over time.</span></p><p><b style=\"font-size: 16px\">Product-savvy technologists.</b><span style=\"font-size: 16px\"> PEs help shape product direction, not just implement requirements. You anticipate whatâs possible, clarify ambiguity, and often write the first version of a spec when needed.</span></p><p><b style=\"font-size: 16px\">Pragmatic long-term thinkers.</b><span style=\"font-size: 16px\"> You balance delivery speed with architectural integrity. You know where to take shortcuts â and where not to.</span></p><p><b style=\"font-size: 16px\">Multipliers.</b><span style=\"font-size: 16px\"> You leave teams stronger: cleaner abstractions, clearer documentation, higher engineering maturity, and faster future delivery.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px\">AI Skills &amp; Leadership</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px\">WISEcode is an AI-native company. Every engineer is expected to use AI well, but PEs set the tone. Youâll:</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px\">â&nbsp;Integrate LLMs and ML components into product workflows where appropriate.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px\">â&nbsp;Understand model behavior enough to guide data quality, explainability, and responsible use.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px\">â&nbsp;Use AI-assisted development to accelerate your own work and teach others how to do the same.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px\">â&nbsp;Advocate for intelligent, data-driven design across ingestion, features, and UX.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px\">AI is not a bolt-on at WISEcode â it is a horizontal capability. PEs ensure it is thoughtfully embedded in the architecture and product surface area.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px\">Key Responsibilities</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px\">â&nbsp;Own architecture for major systems across backend, database/lakehouse, and application layers.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px\">â&nbsp;Lead solution design for high-complexity initiatives and deliver production-ready implementations when needed.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px\">â&nbsp;Define patterns, abstractions, and technical standards that increase velocity and consistency.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px\">â&nbsp;Unblock teams by diagnosing issues across full-stack boundaries (Blazor â API â Postgres â data pipelines).</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px\">â&nbsp;Guide schema evolution, performance optimization, reliability engineering, and security considerations.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px\">â&nbsp;Mentor senior engineers and elevate engineering culture through clarity, documentation, and example. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px\">â&nbsp;Partner closely with product, design, CTO, data, and AI/ML teams to shape roadmap and feasibility.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px\">â&nbsp;Apply AI/ML concepts to improve automation, personalization, data quality, and developer experience.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px\">Required Qualifications</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px\">â&nbsp;BSCS or equivalent engineering degree</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px\">â&nbsp;12+ years of strong professional development experience</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px\">â&nbsp;Extensive hands-on full-stack engineering experience with .NET and ASP.NET</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px\">â&nbsp;Strong ASP.NET Blazor UI experience and genuine enthusiasm for front-end craftsmanship</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px\">â&nbsp;Deep expertise with Postgres, database performance tuning, schema design, and ORMs (especially EF Core)</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px\">â&nbsp;Proven ability to design, scale, and evolve enterprise-grade systems and distributed architectures</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px\">â&nbsp;Track record of technical leadership, mentoring, and cross-team influence</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px\">â&nbsp;Ability to operate independently, set direction, and drive execution in ambiguous contexts</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px\">â&nbsp;Broad systems thinking with depth in multiple technical domains</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px\">â&nbsp;Familiarity with AI/ML concepts and ability to apply them responsibly in product development</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px\">â&nbsp;Startup mindset â adaptability, urgency, pragmatism, and comfort shifting between strategy and hands-on execution</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px\">Why Join WISEcode</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px\">â&nbsp;Build foundational systems for one of the most ambitious food-tech and AI platforms in the world.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px\">â&nbsp;Work directly with the founder and CTO in a fast-moving, mission-driven environment.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px\">â&nbsp;Shape the architecture, culture, and impact of a category-defining company. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px\">â&nbsp;Competitive compensation, benefits, and opportunities for rapid growth and leadership.</span></p><p><br></p><p><i style=\"font-size: 16px\">WISEcode is an equal opportunity employer.

Our current project is a <a href=\"https://design.llcuniversity.com/\">major redesign</a>, which still has a lot of logic to code. After that, you could be working on any number of projects, from interactive tools built from scratch (ex: an Operating Agreement generator) to internal tools for the content team.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As a first step, you’ll get a full walkthrough of what’s been built so far. You might review or audit the code, and you’ll be part of the brainstorming and problem-solving process. You’ll also help us figure out exactly what work still needs to be done.</p>\n<h2><strong>Key Responsibilities:</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Turn detailed Figma designs into a responsive, accessible, and fully functional WordPress site</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Write clean, efficient, and maintainable code using CSS, PHP, JavaScript and HTML.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Make sure everything works across browsers and runs fast</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Work closely with our designer, back-end developer, founder, and SEO strategist to get every detail right — we care deeply about doing great work</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Help improve how we build things by refining our process and sharing ideas<strong><br /></strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Required Skills &amp; Qualifications:</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>10+ years of front-end WordPress experience</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Expert at turning Figma designs into custom WordPress themes</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Strong in CSS, PHP, JavaScript and HTML.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Vast experience using Tailwind CSS in real-world projects</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Strong proficiency in CSS and modern layout techniques (Flexbox, Grid, etc.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Deep understanding of responsive and adaptive design</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>3+ years using Git for version control</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Clear and thoughtful communication in English — written and spoken</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Willing to have honest, open, even though conversations when needed — we care about trust and doing great work together</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A strong culture fit — we're a kind, friendly team that cares about details, good communication, and helping each other do our best work<strong><br /></strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Personal Traits:</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>You have a growth mindset and love learning new things to keep improving your craft</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You bring a positive attitude, take initiative, and enjoy solving tough problems</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You’re comfortable working as part of a team and independently — we work on the Eastern Time zone.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Note: We do lots of video calls and screensharing for brainstorming and troubleshooting.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Why Join Us?</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Collaborate on high-impact projects with a passionate, supportive team.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Embrace a culture that values positivity, growth, and professional excellence.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Enjoy flexibility, autonomy, and opportunities to grow your skillset.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>To apply:</strong> <a href=\"https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/llcu-university-senior-front-end-wordpress-developer-tailwind-specialist\">https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/llcu-university-senior-front-end-wordpress-developer-tailwind-specialist</a></p>", "link": "https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/llcu-university-senior-front-end-wordpress-developer-tailwind-specialist", "budget": null, "proposals": null, "client_country": "CSS", "category": "WordPress", "source": "We Work Remotely - Programming", "source_type": "rss", "created_at": "Fri, 10 Oct 2025 04:11:49 +0000", "crawled_at": "2025-12-03T14:41:59.084011"}

With our SaaS we’re automating a large chunk of the busy-work that accountants are currently handling manually, and are building new tools so they can provide better services to their customers. We aim to optimise their workflow in such a way that accountants can spend more time on the much more impactful and rewarding work of advising their customers, the business owners.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>The good news is we’re succeeding in doing exactly that. Every week more than 15.000 financial service professionals use Silverfin to help and advise more than 400.000 businesses. Our customers adore us! The even better news is there’s still plenty left to work on, and that’s where we hope you come in.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Since November 2023 we are proudly part of Visma - the European leader in mission-critical cloud software, enjoying the power of the Visma brand and resources whilst retaining business autonomy and go-to-market freedom.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><strong>What’s the product team like?</strong></div>\n<div>The product team is a cross-functional team where engineers work together closely with product managers and product designers. The team's input is a user or business problem which it can solve with a high degree of autonomy. From day one all profiles are involved in understanding the problem, ideating solutions and doing quick experiments to prove that a certain solution might actually lead to the desired outcome. After the discovery phase the same team is tasked with the delivery of the chosen solution. The team will then track the adoption of the solution and will make sure that the problem is actually solved. The setup of the team is largely based on the book \"Inspired\" by Marty Cagan.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><strong>What does working at Silverfin look like?</strong></div>\n<div>Next to the four product teams, there are three more platformy teams, who own complex subsystems, like syncs or AI, and or support the product teams with knowledge, frameworks and services.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Our ops team ensures things run smoothly, deploys happen correctly, and will work with you when issues should arise. We’re enthusiastic followers of the devops mindset, which means ops and developers work together to solve problems, and empower each-other to be self-sufficient, instead of throwing problems over the wall to the “other side”.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>We run an up-to-date Rails monolith on the backend, with PostgreSQL and Redis for persistence and caching, and everything is running on a Kubernetes cluster in Google Cloud. Our daily tools include GitLab, Quip and Slack, with Google Meet as our remote conferencing tool of choice.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>No code gets deployed without a code-review by a peer and testing is a must. Our pipeline automates deployment when the suite is green, and deploys happen dozens of times a day. Each team is currently doing Kanban, but they’re free to follow whatever process suits them best. There are regular retros held to work towards continuous improvement.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Software for accountants is not considered to be very exciting, but we have our fair share of technical challenges. To give you a sense of scale: our database exceeds 10TB*, and our largest table has crossed the 10 billion row mark a long while back. We interface with more than 30 different external APIs, and provide third parties an API of our own.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>*: Our ops team noted that this actually isn’t that hard to achieve if you’re just indexing everything, but it still sounds impressive, right?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><strong>What makes the engineering team at Silverfin special?</strong></div>\n<div>We’re a remote-first engineering team of 40 people distributed in 14 different countries over two continents. A priority for us is maintaining proper work-life balance. We avoid meetings as much as possible, accept deadlines only when absolutely necessary, and never expect anyone to work longer hours than they’ve signed up for. A day in our working lives is pretty boring, and we feel that’s exactly how it should be.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Working with us means you can be flexible with your schedule. It’s OK to disappear for a few hours in the middle of the day to run some errands, get a haircut, pick up the kids - whatever reason, you don’t need to explain yourself.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>You also fully decide when you take time off: our team is sufficiently varied and well organised that there are always enough people around to handle the load, and in the rare cases it’s not, we will decrease the load i...", "link": "https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/silverfin-experienced-ruby-product-engineer", "budget": null, "proposals": null, "client_country": "and your role", "category": "JavaScript", "source": "We Work Remotely - Programming", "source_type": "rss", "created_at": "Mon, 17 Nov 2025 10:57:05 +0000", "crawled_at": "2025-12-06T04:39:28.618780"}

In 8 peer-reviewed publications, DynamiCare increased quit rates for opioids, stimulants, alcohol, and tobacco by 2-4x compared to typical treatment. DynamiCare has won FDA Breakthrough Status and is already breaking into U.S. healthcare system reimbursement with partners that include the State of Rhode Island, Allegheny County of Pennsylvania, BCBS of Massachusetts, Horizon BCBSNJ, Spring Health, and Cityblock Health.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We understand that recovery isn't one-size-fits-all, which is why our platform provides the flexibility and continuous support needed for sustainable behavior change. We're transforming addiction care and helping more people reclaim their lives from substance use disorders. Through the Digital Recovery Platform, DynamiCare is bringing proven therapeutic approaches into the digital age, making recovery support available whenever and wherever our members need it most.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>About the job</strong></p>\n<p>Working as a Full-Stack Engineer at DynamiCare, you'll join a fully remote Agile team to design, build, and maintain secure, evidence-based applications. Since we're a small business, you'll have the opportunity to wear many different hats related to DevOps, Security, and other engineering-related fields.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As the primary developer at DynamiCare, you'll have ownership over the codebase, making this a huge opportunity for impact. There will also be room for growth in terms of leadership as the team expands, with potential to shape practices, mentor future developers, and take on greater responsibility in technical decision-making.</p>\n<p>We are currently striving to expand our user base and increase retention rates, with a Series A funding round on the horizon. We use a Ruby on Rails application, which powers multiple subdomains and includes a REST API that supports our member-facing React Native mobile app, as well as an Analytics application utilizing ActionView, React, and Stimulus.</p>\n<p>We believe DynamiCare is a great place to work. You'll collaborate in real time to make informed product decisions and play an active role in shaping the company's direction every day. We value your time and mental well-being, and we offer flexibility in working hours and time off. While there may be times when you need to jump in to resolve a critical bug, we strive to stay calm, focus on the root cause, and improve our workflows rather than place blame.</p>\n<p>Here are some examples of the work you might be doing at DynamiCare:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Monitoring and responding to mobile and server package vulnerabilities, applying patches promptly, and evaluating whether they pose any risk to our users.</li>\n<li>Refactor Rails models to enhance feature development and data processing efficiency.</li>\n<li>Improve our appointment tracking features to include recurring appointments.</li>\n<li>Maintaining a probability engine used to schedule substance tests, ensuring functionality by writing a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests.</li>\n<li>Building new serializers in Rails to help export data in XLSX or CSV format so that our team has insights on key metrics.</li>\n<li>Creating and maintaining new background jobs to improve the scalability and performance of our application.</li>\n<li>Ensuring data security, privacy, and compliance with HIPAA.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>About you</strong></p>\n<p>We’re seeking a candidate with a passion for technology and a motivation to make the world a better place.</p>\n<p>Your primary responsibilities will include full-stack development, DevOps, and maintaining strong data security across our platform. You should have at least three years of experience with our core frameworks: Ruby on Rails and React Native. Experience deploying and managing applications using CircleCI, Aptible, and AWS is especially valuable.</p>\n<p>Experience working within the confines of HIPAA and 42 CFR Part 2 is a strong plus, given the sensitive nature of our work. We’re also looking for someone familiar with Agile development, particularly Scrum and sprint-based workflows. Proficiency with collaboration and project management tools like Asana, Confluence, and Jira is important for staying aligned with the team.</p>\n<p>Even though you’re experienced, we don’t expect you to hit the ground running on day one. We value thoughtful onboarding and provide you with the time and support needed to learn our systems and processes. Strong communication is essential here, whether you're debugging code, collaborating with designers, or explaining technical concepts to non-technical teammates.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We also foster a collaborative environment where every voice is heard, and respectful dialogue and constructive feedback are encouraged. Our shared goal is to build a product that helps people recover from addiction, and we believe that happens best when everyone works together with openness and clarity.</p>\n<p>A Computer Science degree or equivalent is not required for this position. If you have the chops and the skills needed to do the job well, that’s all that matters.</p>\n<p>While you’ll report to our Director of IT &amp; Engineering, we strongly believe in autonomy here at DynamiCare. It’s vital that you know how to manage your time, and we trust that you will as well. Investing the time and effort here will help advance your career and expose you to new and exciting challenges.</p>\n<p>This position is remote and operates on Eastern Time.

Our interview process starts with an intro call to answer any questions you have about the role and to learn a bit more about your experience and interests.</p>\n<p>From there, we’ll follow up with a panel interview call where you get to meet a few members of our team, to openly discuss some of our challenges and ensure your skills and interests align with where we’re going as a business.</p>\n<p>For qualified candidates, the process wraps with a reference call, and an offer to follow.</p>\n<h2><strong>How we work:</strong></h2>\n<p>We believe that there’s a better balance between the poles of freelancing &amp; full time, and for that reason Sanctuary works differently to most shops:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://sanctucompu.substack.com/p/our-open-source-2020-profit-and-loss\"><strong>Transparency &amp; Ownership:</strong></a>&nbsp;We release out Profit &amp; Loss statements to the community each year, open source our best ideas, and talk business &amp; money with everyone in the company.

The operating system for folks who build software.</p>\n<p>We started with open-source product analytics,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/story\">launched out of Y Combinator's W20 cohort.</a> We've since shipped <a href=\"https://posthog.com/products\">more than a dozen products</a>&nbsp;including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://posthog.com/docs/data-warehouse\">A built-in data warehouse</a>, so users can query product and customer data together using custom SQL insights.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://posthog.com/docs/cdp\">A customer data platform</a>, so they can send their data wherever they need with ease.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://posthog.com/ai\">PostHog AI</a>, an AI-powered analyst that answers product questions, helps users find useful session recordings, and writes custom SQL queries.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Next on the roadmap are CRM, messaging, revenue analytics, and support products. When we say every product that companies need to run their business, we really mean it!</p>\n<p>We are:</p>\n<p>1. <strong>Product-led</strong>. More than 100,000 companies have installed PostHog, mostly driven by word-of-mouth. We have intensely strong product-market fit.<br />2. <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/aord.html\"><strong>Default alive</strong></a>. Revenue is growing 10% MoM on average, and we're very efficient. We raise money to push ambition and grow faster, not to keep the lights on.<br />3. <strong>Well-funded</strong>. We've raised more than $100m from some of the world's top <a href=\"https://posthog.com/about\">investors</a>. We're set up for a long, ambitious journey.</p>\n<p>We're focused on building an awesome product for end users, hiring exceptional teammates, shipping fast, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://posthog.com/deskhog\">being as weird as possible</a>.</p>\n<h3>Things we care about</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Transparency</strong>: Everyone can read about our roadmap, how we pay (or even let go of) people, our strategy, and how we work, in our <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook\">public company handbook</a>. Internally, we share revenue, notes and slides from board meetings, and fundraising plans, so everyone has the context they need to make good decisions.</li>\n<li><strong>Autonomy</strong>: We don’t tell anyone what to do. Everyone chooses what to work on next based on what's going to have the biggest impact on our customers, and what they find interesting and motivating to work on. <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/wide-company\">Engineers lead product teams</a> and <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/which-products\">make product decisions</a>. Teams are flexible and easy to change when needed.</li>\n<li><strong>Shipping fast</strong>: <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/values#why-not-now\">Why not now?</a> We want to build a lot of products; we can't do that shipping at a normal pace. We've built the company around small teams – autonomous, highly-efficient groups of <a href=\"https://posthog.com/founders/cracked-manifesto\">cracked engineers</a> who can outship much larger companies because they own their products end-to-end.</li>\n<li><strong>Time for building</strong>: Nothing gets shipped in a meeting. We're a natively remote company. We default to async communication – PRs &gt; Issues &gt; Slack. Tuesdays and Thursdays are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/company/culture#were-on-the-makers-schedule\">meeting-free days</a>, and we prioritize heads down building time over perfect coordination. This will be the most productive job you've ever had.</li>\n<li><strong>Ambition</strong>: We want to solve big problems. We strongly believe that aiming for the best possible upside, and sometimes missing, is better than never trying. We're optimistic about what's possible and our ability to get there.</li>\n<li><strong>Being weird</strong>: Weird means redesigning an already world-class website for the 5th time. It means shipping literally every product that relates to customer data. It means building an <a href=\"https://posthog.com/deskhog\">objectively unnecessary developer toy</a> with dubious shareholder value. Doing weird stuff is a competitive advantage. And it's fun.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Who we're looking for</h3>\n<p>We’re looking for a full-stack engineer who knows how to leverage LLMs to make PostHog 10x more powerful. You’ve built and shipped agentic AI applications before and understand it’s more than just hitting an API with a good prompt.</p>\n<p>You’ll fit right in if you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ship end-to-end AI apps — from backend infra to frontend UX.</li>\n<li>Collaborate widely — work across teams, find the right people, and make progress fast.</li>\n<li>Think like a product builder — care about users and outcomes, not just code.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you’ve worked in autonomous agents, workflow automation, or AI copilots before, you’ll feel at home — but here you’ll get to build it from scratch, in the open, with massive impact.</p>\n<h3>What makes this role unique</h3>\n<p>In this role, you’re not hacking together an AI agent hoping someone will use it — you’re building on top of a firehose of real customer data with immediate impact, whether that means creating new AI-powered tools or building observability features that help others understand how their agents perform in the wild.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Impact from day one: You’re building agents on top of real customer data — not toy demos, not “when we get users.”</li>\n<li>Data advantage: PostHog already collects all the context agents need to be useful: analytics, sessions, events, feature flags, and more. You’ll build on top of it all.</li>\n<li>Agents that matter: Instead of copilots on the side, you’ll create background agents embedded into engineering workflows - changing how software gets built. Or, you might focus on building the analytics and observability layer around those agents - surfacing insights, clustering behaviors, and measuring model quality so teams can improve their own AI systems with confidence.</li>\n<li>Build in the open: Work with feedback from the largest open-source product engineering communities in the world.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What you'll be doing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Owning products and features from beginning to end.</strong> This means originating ideas based on your intuition, talking to users, and understanding our strategy and goals. It means testing MVPs in production with real users. It means&nbsp;<a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/engineering/product-engineering\">iterating on their feedback</a>, owning pricing, and ensuring the ongoing success of your work.</li>\n<li><strong>Collaborating with design (when necessary).</strong> Product engineers at PostHog are full-stack, so we expect you to ship and own the basic UX of your work using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://storybook.posthog.net/?path=/story/exporter-funnels--funnel-left-to-right-insight\">our design system</a>. From there, it's up to you to decide when to <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/engineering/product-design\">collaborate with our design team</a> to iterate and polish the experience.</li>\n<li><strong>Implementing AI features</strong>. LLMs, eh? They're getting&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRz8-EXlhBo\">prettaaay, prettaay good</a>. All our products integrate with PostHog AI, so you'll likely be <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/engineering/working-with-max-ai\">working with the PostHog AI team</a> to implement AI features in your products. For some teams, that means designing observability and evaluation features for AI products.</li>\n<li><strong>Talking to users</strong>. Good product engineers read feedback from users and iterate quickly. Great product engineers have users they're friendly with, talk with them frequently, bounce ideas off them, and iterate with them when they ship new things.</li>\n<li><strong>Doing support.</strong> Every week, one person in each engineering team is designated the <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/engineering/operations/support-hero\">Support hero.</a> Their job is to investigate and resolve issues reported by customers for their product. Giving users support from real engineers and shipping fixes and improvements in real-time is one of the best ways to spark joy in users. This role will also include some<a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/engineering/operations/on-call-rotation\"> on-call time</a>, too.</li>\n<li><strong>Writing docs</strong>. We have a content team that will collaborate with you on reviewing, polishing, and improving your documentation, but the best person to document a new feature is the person who built it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Requirements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Full-stack experience with <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/engineering/stack\">relevant technologies</a> – e.g. Python or similar, React or similar, something to do with big data is a bonus.</li>\n<li>Prior experience in AI workflow automation, copilots, or autonomous agent products.</li>\n<li>Ability to choose pragmatic architectures, ship quickly, and iterate based on real feedback.</li>\n<li>Strong sense for UX and product polish.</li>\n<li>Excellent communicator who thrives on collaboration across teams.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Nice to have</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have worked at a high-growth SaaS company before.</li>\n<li>Extensive knowledge of Django and/or TypeScript-based React.</li>\n<li>Experience building AI-native products or integrating AI into existing software.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have a disability, please let us know if there's any way we ca...", "link": "https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/posthog-ai-product-engineer", "budget": "100", "proposals": null, "client_country": "their first day", "category": "React", "source": "We Work Remotely - Programming", "source_type": "rss", "created_at": "Wed, 26 Nov 2025 00:02:22 +0000", "crawled_at": "2025-12-12T12:14:11.103958"}
