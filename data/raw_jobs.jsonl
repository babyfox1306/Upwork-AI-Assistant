When we say every product that companies need to run their business, we really mean it!</p><p>We are:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Product-led</strong>. More than 100,000 companies have installed PostHog, mostly driven by word-of-mouth. We have intensely strong product-market fit.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/aord.html\"><strong><u>Default alive</u></strong></a>. Revenue is growing 10% MoM on average, and we're very efficient. We raise money to push ambition and grow faster, not to keep the lights on.</p></li><li><p><strong>Well-funded.</strong> We've raised more than $100m from some of the world's top <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/strategy/investors\"><u>investors</u></a>. We're set up for a long, ambitious journey.</p></li></ol><p>We're focused on building an awesome product for end users, hiring exceptional teammates, shipping fast, and <a href=\"https://posthog.com/deskhog\"><u>being as weird as possible</u></a>.</p><p><br /></p><h2>Things we care about</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Transparency:</strong> Everyone can read about our roadmap, how we pay (or even let go of) people, our strategy, and how we work, in our <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook\"><u>public company handbook</u></a>. Internally, we share revenue, notes and slides from board meetings, and fundraising plans, so everyone has the context they need to make good decisions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Autonomy:</strong> We donât tell anyone what to do. Everyone chooses what to work on next based on what's going to have the biggest impact on our customers, and what they find interesting and motivating to work on. <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/wide-company\"><u>Engineers lead product teams</u></a> and <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/which-products\"><u>make product decisions</u></a>. Teams are flexible and easy to change when needed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shipping fast:</strong> <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/values#why-not-now\"><u>Why not now?</u></a> We want to build a lot of products; we can't do that shipping at a normal pace. We've built the company around small teams â autonomous, highly-efficient groups of <a href=\"https://posthog.com/founders/cracked-manifesto\"><u>cracked engineers</u></a> who can outship much larger companies because they own their products end-to-end.</p></li><li><p><strong>Time for building:</strong> Nothing gets shipped in a meeting. We're a natively remote company. We default to async communication â PRs &gt; Issues &gt; Slack. Tuesdays and Thursdays are <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/company/culture#were-on-the-makers-schedule\"><u>meeting-free days</u></a>, and we prioritize heads down building time over perfect coordination. This will be the most productive job you've ever had.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ambition:</strong> We want to solve big problems. We strongly believe that aiming for the best possible upside, and sometimes missing, is better than never trying. We're optimistic about what's possible and our ability to get there.</p></li><li><p><strong>Being weird:</strong> Weird means redesigning an already world-class website for the 5th time. It means shipping <em>literally</em> every product that relates to customer data. It means building an <a href=\"https://posthog.com/deskhog\"><u>objectively unnecessary developer toy</u></a> with dubious shareholder value. Doing weird stuff is a competitive advantage. And it's fun.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Who we're looking for</strong></h2><p>We're hiring for a range of roles here. What you end up working on will depend on your exact skillset and preferences, so choose your own adventure.</p><p>In general we seek Product Engineers who are:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Enthusiastic drivers.</strong> We need proactive people that can fully own projects and get them done, and know to get help when needed. This is what being a <a href=\"https://posthog.com/blog/what-is-a-product-engineer\"><u>product engineer</u></a> is all about. \"Are we there yet?\" is the wrong question.</p></li><li><p><strong>Optimistic problem solvers.</strong> Things get hard here sometimes â whether it's scaling, shipping complex products, handling a stream of support requests, or trying to ship something that touches multiple teams. We need people who won't get disheartened, and will collaborate, iterate, and ship their way out of anything.</p></li><li><p><strong>Grown ups.</strong> Weâre an international bunch of weirdos, but one thing unites us: everyone is kind, considerate, and professional towards each other. <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/company/grown-ups\"><u>This isn't about age or experience</u></a>, it's about being low-ego, flexible, and respectful.</p></li><li><p><strong>Genuine builders.</strong> PostHog is full of people who just love building stuff, people who would still be building software even if there wasn't a paycheck at the end. If this sounds like you, we should talk.</p></li></ul><p><br /></p><p>Right now, we are also looking for:</p><ul><li><p><strong>IAM specialist:</strong> Youâll design and ship core features like SAML support, new identity providers, and even our own IAM system. Start with internal tooling, then roll them out to customers. Tell us how youâd make these systems so solid that other teams can build on them without hesitation.</p></li></ul><p><br /></p><h2><strong>What you'll be doing</strong></h2><ul><li><p><strong>Owning products and features from beginning to end.</strong> This means originating ideas based on your intuition, talking to users, and understanding our strategy and goals. It means testing MVPs in production with real users. It means <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/engineering/product-engineering\"><u>iterating on their feedback</u></a>, owning pricing, and ensuring the ongoing success of your work.</p></li><li><p><strong>Collaborating with design (when necessary).</strong> Product engineers at PostHog are full stack, so we expect you to ship and own the basic UX of your work using <a href=\"https://storybook.posthog.net/\"><u>our design system</u></a><strong>.</strong> From there, it's up to you to decide when to <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/engineering/product-design\"><u>collaborate with our design team</u></a> to iterate and polish the experience.</p></li><li><p><strong>Talking to users.</strong> Good product engineers read feedback from users and iterate quickly. Great product engineers have users they're friendly with, talk with them frequently, bounce ideas off them, and iterate with them when they ship new things.</p></li><li><p><strong>Doing support.</strong> Every week, one person in each engineering team is designated the <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/engineering/support-hero\"><u>Support hero</u></a>. Their job is to investigate and resolve issues reported by customers for their product. Giving users support from real engineers, and shipping fixes and improvements in real-time, is one of the best ways to spark joy in users. This role will also include some <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/engineering/on-call-rotation\"><u>on-call time</u></a>, too.</p></li><li><p><strong>Writing docs.</strong> We have a content team that will collaborate with you on reviewing, polishing, and improving your documentation, but the best person to document a new feature is the person who built it.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Requirements</strong></h2><ul><li><p>Full-stack experience with <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/engineering/stack\"><u>relevant technologies</u></a> â e.g. Python or similar, React or similar, something to do with big data is a bonus.</p></li><li><p>Experience taking a project from 0 to 1. You might have led a project, been a founder previously, or built an impressive side project.</p></li><li><p>Strong writing skills. <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/company/culture#we-write-everything-down\"><u>We document everything</u></a>, most of it publicly. The ability to communicate your ideas and make persuasive arguments is essential.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Nice to have</strong></h2><ul><li><p>Have worked at a high-growth SaaS company before.</p></li><li><p>Extensive knowledge of Django and/or TypeScript-based React.</p></li><li><p>Experience building AI-native products, or integrating AI into existing software.</p></li></ul><p><em><br /></em></p><p><em>If you have a disability, please let us know if there's any way we can make the interview process better for you - we're happy to accommodate! </em></p><br/><br/>Please mention the word **ENTICE** and tag RMy4yMzkuMTIwLjg3 when applying to show you read the job post completely (#RMy4yMzkuMTIwLjg3).
